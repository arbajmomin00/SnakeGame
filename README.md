# SnakeGame
Simple implementation of the famous Nokia Snake game in VB .NET

In a 30x30 blocks window you start as a 5 blocks long snake and must use the arrow keys to navigate in the window and eat the white blocks that will randomly appear in the window. Everytime you eat a white block, the snake's length length increases by one.

You must avoid running into your own body, or you will lose all the body you have cut yourself from. 

Since this is test mode, the following cheat buttons are available:
- `x`: slow down the snake
- `y`: speed up the snake
- `c`: augment snake's length by one
- `v`: diminish the snake's length by one
- `space`: remove all snake's blocks and return to length 1
- `r`: pause the game
